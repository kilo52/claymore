# Claymore: Additional Core Libraries for Java

Claymore is a set of core libraries which are often used in my Java projects. I wanted to make some of them open source in the hope that others might find them useful. The provided APIs are complementary to the native Java libraries, for example by adding support for DataFrames, readers/writers for CSV-files, a parser for command line arguments, and more.

## Release: 1. October 2018
